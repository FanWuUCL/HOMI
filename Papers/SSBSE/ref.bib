title={A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: {NSGA-II}},
year={2002},
volume={6},
number={2},
abstract={Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

abstract={Parameterized heuristics abound in computer aided design and verification, and manual tuning of the respective parameters is difficult and time-consuming. Very recent results from the artificial intelligence (AI) community suggest that this tuning process can be automated, and that doing so can lead to significant performance improvements; furthermore, automated parameter optimization can provide valuable guidance during the development of heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we study how such an AI approach can improve a state-of-the-art SAT solver for large, real-world bounded model-checking and software verification instances. The resulting, automatically-derived parameter settings yielded runtimes on average 4.5 times faster on bounded model checking instances and 500 times faster on software verification problems than extensive hand-tuning of the decision procedure. Furthermore, the availability of automatic tuning influenced the design of the solver, and the automatically-derived parameter settings provided a deeper insight into the properties of problem instances.},
